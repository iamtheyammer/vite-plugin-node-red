<!--
This is the Node's "HTML file" that defines the node's UI.
https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/node-html

It MUST be named the same as the node's name, and the same as the folder it's in.
The "JavaScript file" (in this case, TypeScript), also must be in this folder and
named the same as the folder and as this file.

<!--
Node definition: https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/node-html#defining-a-node
Using Rollup allows us to use ES6 modules in the browser.

This is the code that will run in the UI when the node is added to the palette.
-->
<script type="module" src="definition.ts"></script>

<!--
Edit dialog: https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/node-html#edit-dialog
The edit dialog is a simple HTML form that allows the user to configure the node.
-->
<script type="text/html" data-template-name="lowercase">
  <h1>Lowercase Node Settings</h1>
  <p>(there's nothing here)</p>
</script>

<!--
Help text: https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/node-html#help-text
This shows up when the user clicks for "help" on the node in the editor.
-->
<script type="text/html" data-help-name="lowercase">
  <h1>Lowercase</h1>
  <p>Simple node example that lowercases strings passed into it.
    Payload must be a string.
  </p>
</script>
